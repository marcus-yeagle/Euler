Euler
=====

This repo is a collection of Euler Project Solutions by yours truly.


Hopefully none of you are here because you cannot find a particular solution to an Euler Project problem. This Repository is meant to be a collection of my solutions written in various languages including but not limited to: C++, Python, and occasionally MIPS assembly. This is also meant as a collection that is to be critique  and observed. 

Enjoy!
