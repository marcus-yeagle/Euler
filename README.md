Euler
=====

This repo is a collection of Euler Project solutions submitted by yours truly.


Hopefully none of you are here because you cannot find a particular solution to an Euler Project problem. This Repository is meant to be a collection of my solutions written in various languages including but not limited to: C++, Python, Node.js and possibly MIPS assembly. This collection is meant for critiquing and observation. 

Thanks!
